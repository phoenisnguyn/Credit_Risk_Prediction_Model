# Credit Risk Prediction Model

### Detail: [Here](https://github.com/phoenisnguyn/Credit_Risk_Prediction_Model/blob/main/Credit_Risk_final%20(2).ipynb)

A Machine Learning model for predicting credit risk using algorithms like CatBoost and XGBoost, achieving an accuracy of 93.87%. The project focuses on quantitative analysis and classification to build an effective loan approval strategy.



## üöÄ Key Features

- Multidimensional analysis of factors influencing credit risk
- Predictive modeling with CatBoost (AUC 95%)
- Handling imbalanced data and multicollinearity
- Performance comparison across multiple algorithm

## üß† Credit Risk Prediction App

Try the app live [**here**](https://creditriskapp-vsxpewncyjc3zkplnb5yhu.streamlit.app/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The app may take a few seconds to load initially, as it is hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud** (free tier), which can introduce some startup delay.

This is a **Credit Risk Assessment Tool** that predicts the creditworthiness of clients based on their input data. It allows users to:

- Enter customer information (e.g., age, income, job, etc.)
- Get instant prediction results (credit approved or not)
- Visualize feature contributions using SHAP values
- Understand how individual factors affect the decision

Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and a machine learning model trained on real-world credit data.
